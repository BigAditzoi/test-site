        <p>After spending 4 months in Rousillon, in France and suffering a 
            few disappointments we decided to head down the Mediterean coast 
            towards <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valencia">Valencia</a>. That was part of our plan B. If France 
        wouldn't work, we would then try:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Spain</li>
            <li>Italy</li>
            <li>Portugal</li>
            <li>Greece</li>
            <li>and, finally, Romania</li>
        </ol>
        <p>During a small interlude in Barcelona with some buddies
            from my last place of work, which happened to flew in from 
            Luxemburg, where they were on assignment, one of them suggested
            to venture a stop in Javea, where he had spent a vacation 
            with his family a few years back.</p>
        <p>We weren't too sure, especially after we arrived in Valencia
            and found a listing for a penthouse in a very nice area
            at a reasonable price.</p>
